Ecology and Evolution

Scrips include procedures to: 

1) Pull data from the Movebank data repository (01.01), 
2) Process with movement models (01.02, 01.02.03), 
3) Extract oceanography for modeled positions (04.01), 
4) Estimate distance of nomadic movements for Pomarine Jaegers (03), 
5) Plot movements on maps for figures (02, 02.02). Note: Finishing touches to figures were completed in Adobe Illustrator. Satellite maps were extracted using Google Earth Engine
